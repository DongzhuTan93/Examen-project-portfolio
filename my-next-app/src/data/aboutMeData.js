    bio: 'I have a bachelors degree in computer science from Linnaeus University in Kalmar, Sweden. Before I started working independently, I worked as a full stack developer at Mediatool, a media management platform that recently raised €70 million. Here, my team and I worked to implement features based on the needs of large clients such as Heineken and H&M. Work we undertook included developing a raw-data importer that allowed customers to upload unstructured data from Excel files. This data was then parsed using AI algorithms to convert it into a format that could be integrated into Mediatools existing database structure. Earlier on in my career, I also founded a cleaning company, Ungdomsstäd, with 15 employees, which got acquired by Swedens largest home cleaning company, Hemfrid. During my time here, I worked a lot with having a close and personal dialogue with our customers and learned how important a good reputation is. On my free time, I like to hit the gym and go kitesurfing!'
